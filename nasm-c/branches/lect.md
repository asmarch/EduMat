## Branches logic
## Branch types
## Conditional logic    
## Basic conditional logic example  
```c
if <<logic statement>>{
//program logic is here
}   
// Result of every logical statement is   Logical 1 -> True
``` 
 Logical 0 -> False  
If the logical value is Logical 1 -> True then  the instructions in the if block {...} will be executed. If the result is Logical 0 -> False then the logic won't be executed.  
In the file program.c are compared 2 variables.  Variable b=1 if user enter value for a=1 then Logical result will be 1 and message will be "Yes".   Otherwise the message will be "No".  
##  Non-conditional (direct) logic
Direct logic can be implemented without usage of if statement. Instead of if statement - goto statement can be used.
