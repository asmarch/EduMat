## Goto statement
Goto statement is used for non-conditional direct execution of instructions.  
In order to use goto operator we must define a label witch contains program logic and we can combine usage of if statements and goto statements.    
All labels must be defined before their usage.  
If the logical result is 1 then we can goto target label.  
We can combine usage of conditional and non-conditional logic together.  
In fact in assembly language we have conditional and non-conditional jumps.
