## Arrays
By definition array is structure that has n elements. Every array has a type and it's elements are those type. In some programming languages like PHP and Python,  arrays can has different types of  elements.  
## Array declaration examples
```c
int arr=[1,2,3]
printf(arr[1]) ; //result will be 2
```
## Function prototypes
According to function prototypes in file program.h, our functions are:
| Function   | Arguments   |
|--------------|--------------|
| arrcounter | count of array elements |
| minel -> for minimal element of the array  |
| maxel -> for max  element of the array  |
|averageel -> for average element of the array.  |
## Types of function arguments
| Function   | Arguments   |
|--------------|--------------|
|Function arrcounter takes as argument | pointer to int. |
| Function minel takes as arguments | pointer to int and int variable.  |
| Function maxel takes as arguments | pointer to int and int variable. |   
|  Function averageel takes as arguments | pointer to int and int variable. | 
## Function Definitions
All functions are defined by their return type and arguments type according to function prototypes.  
Functions illustrate different array  algorithms.  
## Function calls
All function calls are in the main() function.  
There are only 2 argument  variables declarated in main() function.  
There are function result variables declared after argument variables.  
And printf() for each function.
