## Introduction

This repository covers three main areas:

1. **x86 Assembly Programming**: Learn how to write assembly code for x86 architecture, understand low-level operations, and interface with hardware directly.
2. **ARM GNU Assembly Programming**: Explore assembly programming for ARM processors using the GNU assembler, focusing on modern ARM architecture.
3. **C Programming**: Understand how to write efficient C code that interacts with low-level hardware components, using both x86 and ARM architectures.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `basics/`: Covers the basics of NASM assembly language, providing a solid foundation for beginners.
- `nasm-c/`: Contains examples, tutorials, and exercises for combining x86 assembly programming (using NASM) with C programming.
- `gnuasm-c/`: Includes resources for ARM GNU assembly programming with a focus on integrating C code.
- `nasm-gnuasm/`: Provides examples and exercises that demonstrate the integration and comparison of x86 NASM and ARM GNU assembly programming.
- `tasks/`: A collection of tasks and challenges designed to test your knowledge and understanding of the topics covered in this repository.
