## Introduction

This repository covers three main areas:

1. **x86 Assembly Programming**: Learn how to write assembly code for x86 architecture, understand low-level operations, and interface with hardware directly.
2. **ARM GNU Assembly Programming**: Explore assembly programming for ARM processors using the GNU assembler, focusing on modern ARM architecture.
3. **C Programming**: Understand how to write efficient C code that interacts with low-level hardware components, using both x86 and ARM architectures.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `x86_assembly/`: Contains examples, tutorials, and exercises for x86 assembly programming.
- `arm_gnu_assembly/`: Includes resources for ARM assembly programming using the GNU assembler.
- `c_programming/`: Provides C code examples that demonstrate how to interact with hardware at a low level.
- `docs/`: Documentation and additional resources related to the topics covered in this repository.
- `tools/`: Scripts and utilities to assist with development and debugging.
- `examples/`: A collection of example programs across all topics.
